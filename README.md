# Sam's Notes
Due to my lack of knowledge of ActionScript 3, I was not able to add much to my game. I was aiming to create a perfectly fair competitive version of Pong, so that people could see who truly was better at Pong. I was able to add local multiplayer and remove the extra ball. I had planned for the ball to change colour every time it hit a paddle, but I did not know how to implement it. I had also planned to add peer-to-peer multiplayer, but I had no clue how to get that working. The last feature that I wanted to add was 2 separate winning screens for each player, however, ActionScript wasn't working with me, so that feature was cut at the last moment. I am quite disappointed that this is all I have to show for the whole project, but handing in something while it is incomplete is better than not handing it in until past the deadline.
